# Vlookup-for-Reconciliations
This project is intended to be used for the use of Vlookup's for Reconciliations.
The process is we export all of the users who have access to these tables in a program called TMF to an excel sheet and do various vlookups in excel to map the users who have an active request in a database and make sure they have the correct access, make sure they have access to the tables, and make sure nobody with an inactive request has access. The goal of the process is to merge three spreadsheets into one and make an action column for me to go in and take the action.
